# UnityVuvoriaImageTargetObject-Audio

Here is my project for using Vuvoria on Unity. 
1. I am traying to make Apps Scanner Augmented Reality 
2. The Image target trained form vuvoria and become my marker
3. When the Marker detected by the vuvori AR Camera, there will show my 3D Objcet, its animation, and at the same time triggering the attached audio source

//The main part is how to triggering the audio source, with more than one image target, and here is my simple project

//using vuvoria 8.5.9

// setting up the default script from  DefaultTracableeventHandler.cs from Image target 

//LeanTouch is asset from unity market FREE using for scalling and rotate 3D object by touchscreen

//ToAnotherScenen.cs -- it just scene Manager for load to another scene
